# imdb_sentiment_experiments
Just a repo to try out some different NLP methods to use for sentiment analysis of NLP methods. Will keep updating when trying some new stuff. The notebook currently has the following:
1 . Bag of words method in tensorflow to create the embeddings
2 . Simple lstm to serve as a reference for the sentiment analysis
3 . Structured self attention LSTM (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03130.pdf)
4 . (To come) Transformer analysis
5 . (To come) Bert Analysis
