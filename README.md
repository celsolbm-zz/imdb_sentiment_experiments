# imdb_sentiment_experiments
Just a repo to try out some different NLP methods to use for sentiment analysis of NLP methods. Will keep updating when trying some new stuff. The notebook currently has the following:

1 . Bag of words method in tensorflow to create the embeddings

2 . Simple lstm to serve as a reference for the sentiment analysis in pytorch (SimpleLSTM)

3 . Structured self attention LSTM (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03130.pdf) in pytorch (AttentionLSTM)

4 . (To come) Transformer analysis in pytorch

5 . (To come) Bert Analysis in pytorch
